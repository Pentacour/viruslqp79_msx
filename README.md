# Virus LQP-79 (MSX)
Port to MSX of the Arduboy game [VirusLQP-79](https://github.com/TEAMarg/ID-40-VIRUS-LQP-79) of Team Arg.

## Story
"*Amy lived her happy life in a pretty normal town … until that fateful accident at the nearby research facility. Officials denied the incident at first, until the entire facility was abandoned. Neighbours started acting weird. Amy didn’t feel safe anymore. While trying to leave town, she found herself running from a hoard of zombies. What Amy didn't expect, was to find other survivors. Help her escape and rescue the ones not infected by the LQP-79 virus. Hurry!*"

## How to Play
Use cursors or Joystick to move Amy. Push fire button or space to shoot the zombies. Each shoot spends energy of Amy's weapon. If you have enough energy you can get a mega-shoot with M key or secondary fire button.

Contact with zombies quits Amy's hearts. If zombies hug you, move Amy fast in all directions shooting them!

Save the three survivors of each level and escape through the door before time outs.

Walk the 32 levels and if Amy is agile enough, you will save people of the epidemic. If you take a long time, maybe you will arrive later...

Pause the game with F1.
